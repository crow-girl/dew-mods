* * *   LOVELY KITCHEN   * * *

Version 1.2.0
By Lulu Lovely (Nicole Balch)


= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =


A lovely new kitchen with colorful retro appliances, a stand mixer, cookbooks, mix and match cabinets and counters, and a cake (thatâ€™s no lie)!

Replaces the default farmhouse, cabin, and island house kitchens. Also includes a white wall tile option and a cuter coffee maker.

You can also add "Lovely Kitchen Islands and Extras" for coordinating kitchen islands, freestanding cabinets and more.
